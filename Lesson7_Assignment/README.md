### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that unlike some languages I've learned, jQuery statements have an "initiator" that goes before every statement: "$".
2. I learned that with jQuery, you can select other elements in relation to selection by using jQuery DOM traversal methods.
3. I learned that you can group several jQuery statements together to create functions.
